Convention:
- stim and choice: 2 means right, 1 means left

Behavioral logs:
- data.response:
	(MATLAB times)
	- earlyCueTime: when cue is played 
	- trialstart: when trial starts (stim is presented)
	- timePC: (struct of time from trialstart to decision time (choice != 0),
		time is relative to trialstart)
	- rewardtimes: reward is given (delay to reward determined by data.params.rwdDeliveryDelay)
	- trialtime: end of trial

	(Arduino times, look at data.response.time and data.response.dx)
	- precue_samples_start: when cue is played ~ earlyCueTime
	- samples_start: when trial starts ~ trialstart
	- samples_stop: when trial ends (decision time (choice != 0)) ~ timePC
	- samples_reward: reward is given ~ trialtime (MATLAB)
